      <div class="intro">
        <p>
          <sup>1</sup>I believe that the only possible way for our newly
          acquired land to be brought into the United States of America is as
          free land, which would set the groundwork for the abolition of slavery
          and the freedom for all in this country by exemplifying the possible
          success of a non-slavery state.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph_2">
        <p>
          I predict that the economic effects of banning slavery in the Western
          land will be extremely beneficial to the entire country. Primarily,
          banning slavery allows for a free labor market in these new states, a
          market that every person in the US, white and black, male and female.
          If slavery were to be allowed, new plantations would surely form given
          California’s warm climate, bringing many thousands of slaves with
          them.<sup>2</sup> This is far worse for the average American than the many jobs
          that would be created in this free land, as the majority of Americans
          wouldn’t get the chance for social mobility, while others would miss
          the opportunity to feed their families.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph_3">
        <p>
          As Lydia Maria Child notes in her book The Frugal Housewife, women are
          still active parts of the labor market, doing things like sewing
          clothes and cooking meals for a wage.<sup>3</sup> This means that for marginalized
          groups, like women and free blacks, this would create the opportunity
          to be incorporated as equal members of society and avoid a future of
          low wages and long hours.<sup>4</sup>
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph_4">
        <p>
          The competition created by this influx of labor would create a
          thriving economy in the West, which could then be used as a model for
          the rest of the country.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph_5">
        <p>
          Making Western land free is also important from a religious
          perspective. Many people across the country are Christians, as shown
          by the “deep interest” blacks have in the Church and the
          “encouragement from all classes” that preachers receive.<sup>5-6</sup> In fact,
          many southern plantation owners read certain Bible passages to their
          slaves, including the story of Noah, to reinforce the idea that
          slavery is good.<sup>7</sup> However, the Bible can also be used to prove
          otherwise, specifically in the book of Exodus, which gives the slaves
          hope that they will be eventually freed.<sup>8</sup>
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph_6">
        <p>
          Since religion is already a large part of life in California, it is
          logical that religion will continue to spread throughout the West.<sup>9</sup> If
          religion is prevalent, and an important guide for how people live
          their lives, having a unified Church and the unified people that come
          with it is critical to the success of the West. Therefore, slavery
          must be abolished in these areas, so that the Church and its ideas may
          stay unified, a unity that would contribute significantly to the
          success of the Western states.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="conclusion">
        <p>
          If Western states can be successful without slavery, which I believe
          they can for the reasons explained above, it would be a very important
          step towards the abolition of slavery. These Western successes could
          then be applied in the South, continuing the long and difficult
          process of abolition, eventually resulting in the freedom of African
          Americans. At that point, the rights and liberties of all groups would
          be reexamined, and many groups would be given full rights, finally
          establishing the great American goal of all being created equal.<sup>10</sup>
